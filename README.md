restbus
=======

Converts the [NextBus Inc. XML feed][1] into a RESTful JSON API.

The NextBus Inc. XML feed provides useful data to build real-time transit applications, but it ignores three key
components of the web:

* HTTP
* REST
* JSON

To make interfacing with the NextBus Inc. XML feed easier with JavaScript MVC frameworks like Backbone.js or
AngularJS, install and use [restbus][0] as a proxy server for your application.

All documentation is hosted at [restbus.info][0].
